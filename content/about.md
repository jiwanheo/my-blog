Hi! My name is Jiwan Heo (Same pronunciation as Obi-Wan Kenobi) and I'm a business intelligence advisor at Minto Group, where I work on all things related to data & BI in the revenue management team. I finished my undergrad in finance/statistics at Carleton U in fall 2019, and was lucky enough to start my career before 2020 ðŸ˜… 

I love using `tidyverse` & `tidymodels` to try out new statistical concepts I'd just learned about! Also, I'm very passionate about educating other about the benefits of using R and RStudio. (A nice Rmarkdown report with codes hidden, in my opinion, is one of the best business tools around)

When I'm not on my laptop, I like cooking, playing guitar and learning french.
