Hi! My name is Jiwan Heo. I'm a software engineer at Atorus. I mainly code in 
Node.js for full-stack web development, and R for data analysis. I have a curious
mind of a child, and am always learning new stuff. Outside my coding life, I love 
travelling and cooking!

If you're interested in the stuff on this blog, or have any questions, shoot me an email at jiwanheo123@gmail.com!
