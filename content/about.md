Hi! My name is Jiwan Heo (Same pronunciation as Obi-Wan Kenobi). I work in Canadian real estate, doing data and BI in the revenue team. I love coding in R for lots of things, like business reporting with R Markdown, and making aRt! (hoping to add Shiny dev in here very soon ðŸ‘€)

When I'm not in RStudio, I like cooking, playing guitar, reading and learning french.
