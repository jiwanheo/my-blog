<p>“Dad, did you get a haircut?” “No, I got them all cut!”</p>
<p>Hiya, pretty uneventful month lol I did get vaxxed, so that’s good!</p>
<p>I’m getting more interested in making arts with ggplot. This means catching up in geometry, and some maths. I’m in need of a structure though. Right now, I just kinda learn whatever looks interesting to me, but it’d be nice to have a checklist of important concepts to learn. I do watch Coding Train on Youtube, which gives an idea of what’s out there.</p>
<p>Norm Powell looks good on the Blazers.</p>
<p>Vanilla is a really good musician.</p>
