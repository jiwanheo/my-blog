<p>Whatâ€™s up yâ€™all, itâ€™s a beautiful summer so far in Ontario, and itâ€™s been a great month again! Iâ€™m writing this in August, but cut me some slack - Iâ€™m on vacation! lol</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve been spending most of my productive free time doing the <a href="https://github.com/sharlagelfand/RecreationThursday">#RecreationThursday</a> challenge on Twitter, and reading a bunch of R books (tmwr, advr, psfds, â€¦)</p>
<p>Of course, every Tuesday, Iâ€™ve been following along with <a href="https://www.notion.so/SLICED-Show-c7bd26356e3a42279e2dfbafb0480073">#SLICED</a> data science competition. Training the models actually eats up my shitty laptop, and most times, Iâ€™m not able to make a good submission within the 2 hour window. So Iâ€™m actually thinking about pulling the trigger on a Macbook with M1 chip.</p>
<p>They poured the foundation at the new place!</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<ul>
<li>Golf. Tons of golf</li>
<li>I should learn Bayesian statistics</li>
<li>Iâ€™m trying to talk to more data science professionals to learn whatâ€™s out there (so far talked to 1 lol)</li>
<li>There are talks of white water rafting with some friends at the end of August ðŸ‘€</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, really good few months lately. Iâ€™m really enjoying life</p>
