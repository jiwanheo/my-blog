What's up y'all, it's a beautiful summer so far in Ontario, and it's been a great month again! I'm writing this in August, but cut me some slack - I'm on vacation! lol

I've been spending most of my productive free time doing the [#RecreationThursday](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/RecreationThursday) challenge on Twitter, and reading a bunch of R books (tmwr, advr, psfds, ...) 

Of course, every Tuesday, I've been following along with [#SLICED](https://www.notion.so/SLICED-Show-c7bd26356e3a42279e2dfbafb0480073) data science competition. Training the models actually eats up my shitty laptop, and most times, I'm not able to make a good submission within the 2 hour window. So I'm actually thinking about pulling the trigger on a Macbook with M1 chip.

They poured the foundation at the new place!

What else? 

- Golf. Tons of golf
- I should learn Bayesian statistics
- I'm trying to talk to more data science professionals to learn what's out there (so far talked to 1 lol)
- There are talks of white water rafting with some friends at the end of August ðŸ‘€

Overall, really good few months lately. I'm really enjoying life
