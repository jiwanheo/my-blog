<p>Hiya, hope you’re doing alright!</p>
<p>This month was pretty eventful! The corona situation looks certainly better than spring, and that means I can enjoy the summer! I still mainly stick to outdoors activities like golf and patios, but that’s all I really need when the weather’s good! All in for the roaring 20’s</p>
<p>I’m fully invested in making generative arts with R. The more I do it, the more I fall in love with making it work. Right now, I’m just about to start the “Rainbow Smoke Bomb”, so stay tuned :)</p>
<p>Lots of 80s pop</p>
<p><em>Kinda</em> cooking again</p>
<p>Working out again! My roommate’s bought some weights</p>
<p>Overall, I’ve been in a great mood this month. Hope you are too. Bye!</p>
