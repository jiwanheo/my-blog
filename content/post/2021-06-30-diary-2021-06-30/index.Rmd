Hiya, hope you're doing alright!

This month was pretty eventful! The corona situation looks certainly better than spring, and that means I can enjoy the summer! I still mainly stick to outdoors activities like golf and patios, but that's all I really need when the weather's good! All in for the roaring 20's

I'm fully invested in making generative arts with R. The more I do it, the more I fall in love with making it work. Right now, I'm just about to start the "Rainbow Smoke Bomb", so stay tuned :)

Lots of 80s pop

_Kinda_ cooking again

Working out again! My roommate's bought some weights

Overall, I've been in a great mood this month. Hope you are too. Bye!
